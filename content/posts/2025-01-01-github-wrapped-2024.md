## GitHub contributions

In 2024, this was the year with the most contributions I've ever made.
I made `1,686` contributions to GitHub, contributed code to some new GitHub organizations like
[@raycast](https://github.com/raycast),
[@denoland](https://github.com/denoland),
[@jsr-io](https://github.com/jsr-io),
[@lycheeverse](https://github.com/lycheeverse),
[@Crossbell-Box](https://githu.com/Crossbell-Box),
and GNOME's [@do-not-theme](https://github.com/do-not-theme).

This year, I am also working hard to enter more fields:

- I tried Bun for the first time in one of my [Simple Icons Extreme](https://github.com/LitoMore/simple-icons-extreme) prorject and put it to use
- I rewrote the [Simple Icons CDN](https://github.com/LitoMore/simple-icons-cdn) project in Deno and contributed code to the [Deno standard library](https://github.com/denoland/std)
- I created my first private SwiftUI project and finished its PoC
- I finished my first Rust Wasm project for my personal use
- and more ...

I will be doing some more in-depth work next year, and I have plans for that, so maybe I'll share it with you in next year's GitHub Wrappped.

## Awards

Here I will nominate and award some issues PRs and other content on GitHub. Since this is my first award ceremony, I will nominate some excellent content before 2024.

### Innovation in Experience Award

> This year I invested some time in improving the developer and user experience. It could be some insignificant detail in your development, or it could be a major innovation in a project. But what they have in common in that they all push your experience to a new stage and may influence future development.

Nominations:

- [badges/shields#9191](https://github.com/badges/shields/pull/9191) - This PR adds support for the auto-sized icons to [shields.io](https://shields.io). It makes your profile pages look neater and more beautiful when dealing with wide icons
- [LitoMore/raycast-cross-extension-conventions](https://github.com/LitoMore/raycast-cross-extension-conventions) - It defines the development approach for cross-extension in Raycast. This repository is also starred by Raycast's CEO

The winner is ... [badges/shields#9191](https://github.com/badges/shields/pull/9191)! This is not only a notable change for shields.io, but also a notable change for the open-source community!

### Best Fun Fact Award

> Today, we gather to celebrate not just achievements, but the joy of knowledge and the delightful surprises that come with it. It is my honor to present the Most Fun Fact Award, an accolade dedicated to those who have the unique ability to enlighten us with fascinating tidbits that spark curiosity and laughter.

Nominations:

- [denoland/dotland#1946](https://github.com/denoland/dotland/pull/1946) - This PR polished the Deno logo but accidentally added a small mouth to our cute Deno. You can also see a similar small mouth design on your Deno 2 logo, but Iâ€™m not sure if the designer used it as Deno's mouth.

### Most Heartbreaking Award

> The relationship between you and your code is like a chance encounter, and you never know when you will face separation. But you have to face it, maybe separation is for a better meeting next time.

Nominations:

- [simple-icons/simple-icons#10019](https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons/pull/10019) - This PR removes all Microsoft brands from Simple Icons

The winner is ... [simple-icons/simple-icons#10019](https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons/pull/10019)! Do you know that even the Visual Studio Code icon was removed? What an earthquake to GitHub!

### Most Ridiculous Award

> When you put your passion into a project regardless of everything, the diversity of the world will always give you some different surprises. It makes you feel that the open-source community can be so ridiculous. With them, your open-source experience becomes so much more fun.

Nominations:

- [simple-icons/simple-icons#7970](https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons/issues/7970) - This issue requests the `SaveWalterWhite.com` to be added to our collection

- [LitoMore/honeypotoberfest](https://github.com/LitoMore/honeypotoberfest) - This repository is a honey pot for Hacktoberfest trash code contributors, and it successfully attracted some contributors to submit issues and PRs

The winner is ... [simple-icons/simple-icons#12312](https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons/pull/12312)! You ask me why? It's eBPF! Do you even code?

### Best Sponsorship Award

> As an open-sourcerer, I believe in the power of collaboration and the importance of giving back to the community. Your support not only helps me financially, but it also motivates me to continue working on these projects and making them better.
