Last year I purchased the [ROG Azoth] for the first time. It's my first ROG device.
I was attracted by the feel and sound of its buttons, and on New Year's Day I decide to purchase it as a gift to myself.
On my birthday this year, I hadn't figured out what kind of gift I would get myself until I saw a review video of the [ROG Azoth Extreme].

### How is the experience on macOS?

I use it on macOS most of the time. It works well on macOS since it has the Mac mode.
You can simply change the Windows/Alt to Option/Command by pressing Fn + Tab.
But you can't use any other features on macOS since the device management software [Armoury Crate] only on Windows.

I tried many ways to install Armoury Crate on macOS:

- Use [CrossOver] - Failed, can't even install.
- Use [Parallels Desktop] with a virtual Windows 10/11 - Failed, it can be installed, but this will fail on upgrading firmware. I guess some utilities don't support the Windows on Arm.

I finally found a old Windows laptop and spent five or six hours upgrading my Windows from Windows 10 version 1609 to 1904 before I could use it (Armoury Crate require Windows 10 version 1903 or later).

### What is the difference between Azoth and Azoth Extreme?

First of all, my these two keywords have different [ROG NX Mechanical Switches]. The Azoth is Blue Switch and the Azoth Extreme is Snow Switch.

The Azoth OLED monitor is black-and-white but the Azoth Extreme one is full-color OLED touchscreen.
But this touchscreen doesn't have many functions. You can only use it for some simple guesture controls. And both of them cannot be customized or programmed.

Another thing is the Azoth Extreme has an adjustable gasket mount, you can easily toggle between two cushioned typing feels via a quick-flip switch.
You can also make more advanced adjustments by removing or replacing the originals in a teardown.
