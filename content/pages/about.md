I'm working on [Simple Icons], [Inquirer.js], [Color], [Flat], [Alfy] and some other projects you might rely on. I'm also active on [Raycast Community], [Kando], [Chalk], [Ink], [meow] and others.

As an open-sourcerer, I believe in the power of collaboration and the importance of giving back to the community.
Your support not only helps me financially, but it also motivates me to continue working on these projects and making them better.

I also like collecting games and toys. In the future, I'm planning to share my collections and experiences through publishing articles, videos, or live streaming.
